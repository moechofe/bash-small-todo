I was using Taskwarrior before but I found it has too much feature for my usage.
I was using Todo.txt before but didn't interface that fill my expectations.

I create a very very small bash script that I'm using every day at work to help me track of my current and future tasks.

### Features:
- task never change ID (not like Taskwarrior)
- 3 fields per tasks: project, title and an optional description
- data file are editable (tab-separated-value)
- complete a task didn't remove it, but comment it in the data file
- colorized by project
- list can be filtered, search term is highlighted
- priority: if project name use upper case, the task will be printed in bold

### Install:

### Syntaxe:

* list task:

  todo
